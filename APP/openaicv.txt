Successfully created an atomic simulation environment, and applied machine learning models to learn to simulate small proteins accurately.

Teaching language models a physical understanding of the world, as well as finding a way to teach models the fundamentals of reasoning...somehow :)


A team concerned with advancing AI beyond the LLM next word prediction paradigm, with gpt-4 this method has proved very useful but is definitely an early stage iteration of future generation AI. This team will be concerned with finding alternative methods, with the focus of pushing the boundaries of our current method as well as creating a real form of thinking within the model...what ever that actually means.


Well to start of, I'm not really a very smart person or exceptional in any academic sense, I am however persistent when things get difficult, I had to implement a complete atomic simulation environment that is accommodating to machine learning models, this implementation was scalable and parallelisable, allowing my company to research the effectiveness of  machine learning models to learn how to simulate proteins.
